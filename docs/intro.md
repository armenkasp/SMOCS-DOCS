# SMOCS Documentation

Welcome to the **SMOCS** - Streaming Monitoring Optimization Control System

## What is SMOCS?

The Streaming Monitoring Optimization Control System (SMOCS) is a python based streaming framework designed around Kafka built to monitor, diagnose, and predict on streaming data. It is designed as a unified architecture that can ingest, transform, and act upon data streams in a configurable and extensible way. The underlying architecture is designed to ingest data streams in a unified structure allowing for the data parsing and preparation to be handled by the framework. This allows the modular agent architecture to leverage the data more efficiently by creating a streaming data structure that is extensible to many different applications.
